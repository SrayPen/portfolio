## Compare planning between AI and humans
Wei Ji Ma lab, Center for Neural Science, NYU (2021.5 — Present)
 - Trained Deep Reinforcement learning models (AlphaZero type agents) to play a planning task of intermediate complexity.
 - Analyzed features learned by the trained Deep Reinforcement learning networks.
 - Studied the learning and planning mechanisms of AlphaZero agents and compared those to a human planning model

## Improve the efficiency of an unbiased log-likelihood estimation method 
Luigi Acerbi lab, Department of Computer Science, University of Helsinki (2021.3 — present)
 - Compared the efficiencies of log-likelihood estimations in different models using Inverse Binomial Sampling with different
allocation methods.
 - Develop a toolbox for a more efficient Inverse Binomial Sampling method that can estimate the log-likelihood unbiasedly.

## The latent factors of complex planning decisions
Wei Ji Ma lab, Center for Neural Science, NYU (2020.10 — Present)
 - Coded a battery of 9 planning tasks and cognitive tasks to run a large web-based online study.
 - Investigated the individual differences and latent structure of planning decisions and modelled how planning is related to basic cognitive abilities.
