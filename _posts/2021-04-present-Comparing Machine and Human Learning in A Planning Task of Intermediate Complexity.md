- Trained Deep Reinforcement learning models (AlphaZero type agents) to play a planning task of intermediate complexity.
- Analyzed features learned by the trained Deep Reinforcement learning networks.
- Studied the learning and planning mechanisms of AlphaZero agents and compared those to a human planning model
