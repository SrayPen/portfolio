I am a fourth year Ph.D. candidate in Computational Neuroscience at New York University. I study how sequences of actions in
complex environments are made in artificial intelligence and in humans. Currently my research projects focus on comparing deep
reinforcement learning algorithms with human planning models, studying the latent factors of complex planning, and improving a
stochastic log likelihood estimation algorithm.
