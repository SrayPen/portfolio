I am a fourth year Ph.D. candidate in Computational Neuroscience at New York University. I work with Dr. Wei Ji Ma studying how sequences of actions in
complex environments are made in artificial intelligence and in humans. Currently my research projects focus on comparing deep
reinforcement learning algorithms with human planning models, studying the individual differences and latent factors of complex planning, and improving a
stochastic log likelihood estimation algorithm.

Besides doing research, I enjoy snowboarding, hiking, baking desserts and playing with cats
