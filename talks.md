I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computational Neuroscience at New York University. I am passionate about the intersection between machine learning and cognitive science. I work with [Dr. Wei Ji Ma](https://www.cns.nyu.edu/malab/) studying how sequences of actions in complex environments are made in artificial intelligence and in humans. Currently my research projects focus on comparing deep reinforcement learning algorithms with human planning models, using large language models to predict human behavior, studying the individual differences and of complex planning, and improving a
stochastic log likelihood estimation algorithm.

Besides doing research, I enjoy snowboarding, hiking, baking desserts and playing with cats
